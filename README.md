# GodotWater

Small experiment with godot and tessellation. This project contains gdscript code to create optimized planes for use with large plane bodies such as oceans.

## Todo
- Better selection of resolutions
- Less visible seams between chunks
- ability to offset chunks position 
- Ocean shader
- Ocean wave generator (FFT work)
- C++ Fork, gdscript is not really fast enough for this kind of operations
